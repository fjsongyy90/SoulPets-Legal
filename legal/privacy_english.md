# Privacy Policy for SoulPets

**Effective Date:** August 25, 2025

Thank you for using SoulPets! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information. Our core philosophy is simple: your data is yours, and yours alone.

### Our Core Principle: We Collect No Personal Data

SoulPets is built from the ground up with privacy as its foundation. We do not collect, store, track, or have access to any of your personal data or your pet's data.

* **No Accounts, No Tracking**: The app does not require you to create an account. [cite_start]We do not use any third-party analytics or tracking tools[cite: 37].
* **Your Data Never Leaves Your Device**: All the information you enter into SoulPets—including your pet's profile, photos, records, reminders, and financial data—is stored 100% locally on your device.

### How Your Data is Stored and Synced

**1. On-Device Storage**

All data you create is stored in a private, local database on your iOS device. We, the developers of SoulPets, have no way of accessing this information.

**2. iCloud Sync**

[cite_start]To provide a seamless experience across your devices, SoulPets uses Apple's iCloud service to sync your data[cite: 1, 3, 6].

* This is an optional feature managed entirely by you and your Apple ID.
* Your data is synced to your **private iCloud database**, which we have no access to.
* The entire process is encrypted and handled by Apple's secure infrastructure.

### Information Apple May Collect

While we do not collect any data, Apple, as the provider of the App Store, may collect anonymized and aggregated data for sales, performance, and crash analytics. This information helps us improve the app. This data is not personally identifiable and is governed by Apple's own Privacy Policy.

### App Permissions

SoulPets may request permission to send you **Local Notifications**. This permission is used solely to deliver the reminders you set within the app (e.g., for vaccinations or medication). These notifications are scheduled and managed entirely on your device.

### Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly obtain parental consent or remove the information.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
